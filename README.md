## Lab Setup

### Tools Used
- **Virtualization Platform**: VirtualBox.
- **Operating Systems**:
   - Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller).
   - Windows Server 2022 (Active Directory Failover).
   - Windows 10 (Client Machine).

## Key Configurations
### 1. Active Directory Setup:

   - Configured the domain controller with a static IP (192.168.1.10).
   - Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
   - Created a domain _mydomain.com_.
  
![Domain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4430bdc0-7b24-4c2d-89b3-ae65bf074271)

### 2. Organizational Units (OUs), Users, and Groups:
 - Designed a structured directory:
   - **OUs**: Created separate OUs for departments (e.g., IT, HR, and Client Computers).
   - **Users**: Added test users to each OU with specific roles.
   - **Groups**: Configured security groups (e.g., Systems Administrators, Cybersecurity Specialists, and Helpdesk) for resource access control.

![OU](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8befe579-17ce-4919-8a17-9b883f247b17)

**2.1 Create Admin Group and Add a member**

In this section, I created and assigned a security group to streamline administrative access within the **01. Jozi_Branch** organizational unit. This involved opening **Active Directory Users and Computers** on mydomain.com, creating a **Universal security group** named Jozi Administrators within the **01. Jozi_Branch** OU, and adding a user to that group via the **Member Of** tab. These steps ensure proper role-based access control and simplify permissions management across the environment.

**2.2 Configure Protected User**

In this section, I configured a protected user account to enhance identity security for high-risk or privileged roles. This process involved opening **Active Directory Users and Computers**, locating the specific account under the appropriate OU, and enabling the **Protected Users** security group membership. By applying this group, the account is shielded from legacy authentication protocols, vulnerable credential mechanisms, and certain impersonation techniques. These settings significantly reduce the attack surface and support a more resilient authentication framework within the environment.


<img width="744" height="497" alt="01  Protected User" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/355effbd-47cf-43df-b4ff-c4a7837955c1" />

### 3. Advanced Security Policies:
In this section, I configured several key security policies to enhance the overall security posture of the network. These included **password policies**, **account lockout**, and **Kerberos**, and . Each of these policies plays a critical role in securing user accounts and preventing unauthorized access to the system. Below, Iâ€™ll walk through each of these settings individually.

**3.1 Password Policy**
  
The **Password Policy** is crucial for ensuring strong, secure passwords that are difficult to guess. I configured the policy to enforce password complexity requirements, expiration, and history to ensure users regularly update their passwords and follow best practices for password creation.

**Explanation:**
I configured the following parameters:
   - **Minimum password length**: 12 characters.
   - **Password must meet complexity requirements**: Enabled.
   - **Maximum password age**: 60 days.
   - **Enforce password history**: 24 passwords remembered.

![PW Policy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7797201d-178b-413a-9fa8-d18d0c884ba7)

**3.2 Account Lockout Policy**

The **Account Lockout Policy** helps prevent brute-force attacks by locking accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.

**Explanation:**
I set the following parameters:
   - **Account lockout threshold**: 10 invalid login attempts.
     - A higher threshold minimizes the risk of accidental lockouts while still protecting against automated brute-force attacks.
     - Setting this too low (e.g., 3-5 attempts) may lead to user frustration and potential lockout attacks on legitimate accounts.
   - **Account lockout duration**: 15 minutes.
     - This is long enough to slow down attackers while ensuring legitimate users regain access relatively quickly.
     - If the lockout duration is too long (e.g., hours), it could significantly impact business operations.
   - **Reset account lockout counter after**: 15 minutes.
     - Resets the failed login attempt counter after a reasonable time frame, preventing cumulative lockouts from minor user errors.

**3.3 Kerberos Policy**
The Kerberos Policy governs how authentication tickets are issued within the domain. By default, Windows uses the Kerberos protocol for secure authentication. I configured the Kerberos policy to enhance security by setting an appropriate ticket lifetime and renewal time. This helps reduce the window of opportunity for ticket replay attacks.

**Explanation:**
I configured:
   - **Maximum lifetime for service ticket**: 10 hours.
   - **Maximum lifetime for user ticket**: 10 hours.
   - **Maximum renewal lifetime**: 7 days.
   - **Enforce user logoff when ticket expires**: Enabled.
