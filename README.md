## Active Directory Home Lab Project

## Overview
This project showcases my ability to design, implement, and manage a secure Active Directory (AD) environment. Using VirtualBox, Windows Server 2022, and Windows 10, I configured a simulated network to demonstrate essential IT administration tasks, including:

- Security-focused Group Policy Object (GPO) configurations.
- Active Directory structure with Organizational Units (OUs), users, and groups.
- Advanced security policies like account lockout, Kerberos, and password policies.
- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) and DHCP management.
- Windows Defender Firewall management.
- Domain-joined client functionality.

The lab consists of:

- **Router** (192.168.1.1): Simulates internet access.
- **Domain Controller** (192.168.1.10): Hosts AD DS, DNS, WSUS, DHCP, and GPO configurations.
- **Windows 10 Client** (192.168.1.100): Domain-joined machine for testing policy application.

## Lab Setup

### Tools Used
- **Virtualization Platform**: VirtualBox.
- **Operating Systems**:
   - Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller).
   - Windows 10 (Client Machine).

## Key Configurations
### 1. Active Directory Setup:

   - Configured the domain controller with a static IP (192.168.1.10).
   - Installed Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS).
   - Created a domain _mydomain.com_.
  
![Domain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f4fb9d3-891d-482a-b7a9-2afb15a38180)

### 2. Organizational Units (OUs), Users, and Groups:
 - Designed a structured directory:
   - **OUs**: Created separate OUs for departments (e.g., IT, HR, and Sales).
   - **Users**: Added test users to each OU with specific roles.
   - **Groups**: Configured security groups (e.g., Administrators, Cybersecurity Specialist) for resource access control.

### 3. Advanced Security Policies:
In this section, I configured several key security policies to enhance the overall security posture of the network. These included **password policies**, **account lockout**, and **Kerberos**, and . Each of these policies plays a critical role in securing user accounts and preventing unauthorized access to the system. Below, Iâ€™ll walk through each of these settings individually.

**3.1 Password Policy**
  
The **Password Policy** is crucial for ensuring strong, secure passwords that are difficult to guess. I configured the policy to enforce password complexity requirements, expiration, and history to ensure users regularly update their passwords and follow best practices for password creation.

**Explanation:**
I configured the following parameters:
   - **Minimum password length**: 12 characters.
   - **Password must meet complexity requirements**: Enabled.
   - **Maximum password age**: 60 days.
   - **Enforce password history**: 24 passwords remembered.

**3.2 Account Lockout Policy**
The **Account Lockout Policy** helps prevent brute-force attacks by locking accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.

**Explanation:**
I set the following parameters:
   - **Account lockout threshold**: 10 invalid login attempts.
     - A higher threshold minimizes the risk of accidental lockouts while still protecting against automated brute-force attacks.
     - Setting this too low (e.g., 3-5 attempts) may lead to user frustration and potential lockout attacks on legitimate accounts.
   - **Account lockout duration**: 15 minutes.
     - This is long enough to slow down attackers while ensuring legitimate users regain access relatively quickly.
     - If the lockout duration is too long (e.g., hours), it could significantly impact business operations.
   - **Reset account lockout counter after**: 15 minutes.
     - Resets the failed login attempt counter after a reasonable time frame, preventing cumulative lockouts from minor user errors.

**3.3 Kerberos Policy**
The Kerberos Policy governs how authentication tickets are issued within the domain. By default, Windows uses the Kerberos protocol for secure authentication. I configured the Kerberos policy to enhance security by setting an appropriate ticket lifetime and renewal time. This helps reduce the window of opportunity for ticket replay attacks.

**Explanation:**
I configured:
   - **Maximum lifetime for service ticket**: 10 hours.
   - **Maximum lifetime for user ticket**: 10 hours.
   - **Maximum renewal lifetime**: 7 days.
   - **Enforce user logoff when ticket expires**: Enabled.

### 4. Routing and Access Role:
- Installed the Routing and Remote Access service (RRAS).
- Configured the router for VPN access and internal routing, ensuring connectivity between different network segments.



### 5. DNS and Active Directory Integration:
 - Configured DNS on the domain controller to support name resolution for domain-joined devices.

![DNS](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f712ea5-ae33-4cfa-9513-767296d07d1a)

 - Integrated DNS with Active Directory to facilitate domain controller location and service resolution.

### 6. Windows Server Update Services (WSUS):
 - Configured WSUS to manage Windows updates for all domain-joined devices.

![WSUS_Updates](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8d4f404-8b93-4b99-9a25-761a30308840)

### 7. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):
 - Set up DHCP on the domain controller for automatic IP address allocation.
 - Configured DHCP scopes and options to support network clients.

![DHCPScope](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c789141f-8ea6-4d3d-9b3b-3a81453bb40b)

### 8. Security Group Policy Objects (GPOs):
 - Configured additional GPOs for firewall rules and user restrictions.
 - Applied GPOs to OUs to enforce specific security policies based on department.

 - Configured Windows Event Logging to capture and review security events for compliance and troubleshooting.

![LogginNAuditingSetUp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4e0cdde7-fa38-49cb-9499-371600111050)
